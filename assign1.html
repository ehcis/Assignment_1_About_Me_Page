        <h2> Personal Info:</h2>
        <hr>

        <p> I am a 24 year old computer science major at CSUSB, I have been going to
            CSUSB now for over 2 years since transferring from Riverside City College.
            I am in my last semester here, I originally had thoughts about going to grad 
            school but have since changed my mind. I am a aspiring software engineer I have 
            been lucky to have some experience in field thanks to a couple of internships
            I've done over the past years. When I graduate I hope to hopefully a land a job so 
            that I can continue to grow and learn new skills because I am very passionate about
            this field.

        <h2> Skills:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> As far as skills go the various programming langagues that I have used
            over the years ranging from being most comfortable with to least comfortable with have been:
            Python, C#, C++, and Java. Most of my time programming has been using mainly Python even though
            I started with C++ at first. I have done most of my school related projects using Python and small
            projects doing C++. Some of my biggest projects that I've been apart of and completed include making 
            a remote RC car using a phone app and making my own FPS video game.

        <h2> Hobbies & Likes:</h2>
        <hr> 
        <p> Other than programming, I have quite a lot of hobbies that I like to do on my
            free time. Some of my favorite hobbies include boxing, weight training, hiking,
            and gaming. I like being an active person which is why most of my hobbies include doing 
            intensive stuff like excersing. Since I also enjoy gaming, I also like to make my own
            little video games. As stated earlier, I have made own FPS game before with help of friends
            and have been making little games since I was in 6th grade when I use to have a computer teacher who would
            show me how to do it.
